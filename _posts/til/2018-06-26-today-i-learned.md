## Oracle introduced a monthly subscription for Java SE.
* Organizations that require commercial support/licensing/features need to subscribe.
* Organizations or developers that don't require commercial support can use [OpenJDK](http://jdk.java.net/) (from Oracle but targeting developers).
* Those who've already installed Oracle JDK or OpenJDK are unaffected.
