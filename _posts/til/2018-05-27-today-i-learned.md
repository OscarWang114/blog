## Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  * Requires users to present 2 different evidences/factors to confirm their identity.
  * The 2 factors can be 'something they know', 'something they have', or 'something they are'.
  * Example: To withdraw money from an ATM, you need **a password you know** + **a bank card you have**.
  * Generalization: Multi-factor authentication.

## Two-step authentication
  * Similar to 2FA, but uses 'something they know' + a second factor other than 'something they have', or 'something they are'.
  * The second factor can be a code sent via text, voice call, or an app.
  * Example: Google authenticator provides a 6- to 8-digit one-time password.

## One-time password
