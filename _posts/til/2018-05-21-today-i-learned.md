## The existence of [Google Code of Conduct](https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html)
* Google is a _dog company_. (Why not cats? ðŸ˜¢)
* _Don't be evil_ is mentioned in the end.

## Serialize and Hydrate an object
* Serialize: translate it into a suitable format for
network transfer or storage. e.g., `JSON.stringify()`.
* Hydrate: filling an existing object with data. Here the object has been
instantiated, but no data is loaded yet.
