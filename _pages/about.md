## Hi there, welcome to my blog!

## Why I created this blog?

- **Improve my writing skills**<br/>
Practice makes *better*. I want to sharpen my writing skills by writing on a regular basis. Language priority: 1.English 2.Japanese 3.Chinese

- **Today I Learned**<br/>
Today I Learned (TIL) is not only a place to write down the new things I've learned every day but also a reminder telling me to keep learning. You can find all the TILs under the [til category](../categories/).

- **Gain a better understanding**<br/>
I often find myself searching for the same CS question multiple times, e.g "Interface vs Abstract Class" or "How do you write something in Java/Python/JavaScript...?". Such behavior usually reflects a shallow understanding of the subject.

- **Cheatsheets + Interview Prep**<br/>


- **Story telling**<br/>
At last, story telling! Share my life.
