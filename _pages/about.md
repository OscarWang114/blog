## Greeting
Hi there! Welcome to my blog!

## Why I created this blog?

- **Improve my writing skills**<br/>
Practice makes **better**. I want to sharpen my writing skills by writing on a regular basis. Language priority: 1.English 2.Japanese 3.Chinese

- **Today I Learned**<br/>
Today I Learned (TIL) is not only an idea of writing down the new things I've learned every day but also a reminder telling me to keep learning. You can find all the TILs under the [til category](../categories/).

- **Gain a better understanding**<br/>
I often find myself asking the same CS questions multiple times, e.g "Interface vs Abstract Class" or "How to do something in Java/Python/JavaScript...?". Such behavior usually reflects a shallow comprehension of the subject. To gain a better understanding, I want to answer and summarize some of these questions myself.

- **Cheatsheets + Interview Prep/Experience**<br/>
I guess this one doesn't need much explanation. :-)

- **Storytelling**<br/>
And of course, storytelling! This is the place where I document my life, and I'd like to share some special moments with you.
