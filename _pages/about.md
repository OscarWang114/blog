## Hi there, welcome to my blog!

### Why I created this blog?

- **Improve my writing skills**
Practice makes *better*. I want to sharpen my writing skills through writing regularly. Language priority: 1.English 2.Japanese 3.Chinese

- **Today I Learned**
Today I Learned (TIL) is not only a place to write down the new things I've learned throughout the day but also a reminder telling me to keep learning. You can find all the TILs under the "til" category.

- **Gain a better understanding**
I often find myself searching for the same CS question multiple times, e.g "Interface vs Abstract Class" or "How do you write something in Java/Python/JavaScript...?". Such behavior usually reflects a shallow understanding of the subject.

- **Cheatsheets + Interview Prep**


- **Story telling**
At last, story telling! Share my life.
